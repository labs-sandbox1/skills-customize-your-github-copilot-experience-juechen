# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Students will create a simple API, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ FastAPI Project Setup

#### Description
Set up a new FastAPI project and create a basic API endpoint.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main Python file (e.g., `main.py`)
- Define a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a welcome message as JSON


### 🛠️ Implement CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a simple resource (e.g., items or users).
